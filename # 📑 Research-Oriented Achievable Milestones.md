# 📑 Research-Oriented Achievable Milestones (12–18 months)

## **Stage 1: DSP Foundations (Month 1–3)**

* **Achievable Output**:

  * **Tech Report / Blog**: “Exploring FIR Filters for Drone Signal Processing”
  * Includes: LPF, HPF, BPF, plots, interpretations.
  * Quantifiable: A PDF or GitHub repo with code + explanations.
* 📌 This shows: *basic DSP competency applied to real-world context (drones).*

## **Stage 2: Practical IQ Handling (Month 4–6)**

* **Achievable Output**:

  * **Workshop-style Paper/Report**: “Processing IQ Data for Wireless Signal Analysis”
  * Case study: FM radio / Wi-Fi IQ files.
  * Deliverables: Spectrograms, constellation plots, filters applied, signal presence detection.
* 📌 This shows: *ability to work with real IQ data (the raw material of drones).*

## **Stage 3: Drone-Specific Signal Study (Month 7–9)**

* **Achievable Output**:

  * **Conference-style Paper**:
    “Detection of UAV Control Signals in the 2.4 GHz Band using FIR Filtering and Energy Detection”
  * Use publicly available datasets (e.g., DJI drone IQ samples).
  * Quantitative: detection accuracy, SNR thresholds.
* 📌 This shows: *you can map DSP techniques directly to counter-drone requirements.*

## **Stage 4: Counter-Drone Prototype (Month 10–12)**

* **Achievable Output**:

  * **Full Research Paper**:
    “Lightweight Signal Detection Pipeline for Counter-UAV Systems”
  * Contributions: filter design, energy detection, basic classification (e.g., Wi-Fi vs Drone).
  * Optional: Open-source repo with code & plots.
* 📌 This is your **first “serious” contribution** that can be shared/presented.

## **Stage 5: Advanced Application (Month 13–18)**

Here you pick **Defense** or **Offense** flavor.

* **Defensive Path (Counter-Drone)**:

  * Paper: “Spectrum Monitoring and Adaptive Filtering for Drone Detection under Jamming”
  * Simulated jamming → show filter robustness.

* **Offensive Path (Drone Comms)**:

  * Paper: “Design of a Robust SDR-based Control Link for UAVs in Adversarial Environments”
  * Contributions: spread spectrum / hopping / filtering.

📌 Either one of these is **journal-worthy / high-profile conference-worthy**.

# 🧩 Why This Works

* You’re not just *learning privately*.
* Every **2–3 months** you create a **visible artifact** (paper, repo, PDF).
* This gives:

  1. **Quantified growth** (e.g., 1st report → 2nd workshop paper → 3rd UAV-specific paper).
  2. **Momentum to continue** (because each output is sharable).
  3. **Research narrative** → in 18 months, you can point to a series of works showing evolution from DSP → IQ → UAV detection → applied counter-drone.
