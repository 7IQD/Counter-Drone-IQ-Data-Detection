![alt text](<Generated Image September 04, 2025 - 11_55PM.jpeg>)
## 1. Objective
_State the purpose of this mini lab (why we are designing an FIR low-pass filter)._

## 2. Methodology
_Short description of the tools and steps used (Python, firwin, freqz, matplotlib, etc.)._

## 3. Experiment Setup
- Filter type: FIR Low-Pass  
- Design method: firwin()  
- Sampling frequency: 4000 Hz  
- Cutoff frequency: 1000 Hz  
- Number of taps: 21  

## 4. Observations
_Place for text notes and saved plots._

## 5. Results & Discussion
- What the plots show (linear scale and dB scale).  
- Any trade-offs or designer choices.  

## 6. Conclusion
_Short takeaway message (what you learned / why it matters)._
