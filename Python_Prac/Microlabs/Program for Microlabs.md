### 🎯 1. **Daily Micro-Labs (\~30 min each)**

Design 1 self-contained practical per day:

| Day      | Task                                         | Skill                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ✅ Day 1  | Float→int8 scaling (done today)              | Quantization, typecasting  |
| 🔜 Day 2 | Plot IQ waveform (cosine/sine, phase offset) | Signal structure           |
| 🔜 Day 3 | Add noise + filter it                        | Real-world signal cleaning |
| 🔜 Day 4 | Design metadata structure (manually)         | Format design              |
| 🔜 Day 5 | Read + parse IQ binary file                  | Binary I/O, validation     |
| 🔜 Day 6 | Signature + checksum                         | Integrity + security layer |
| 🔜 Day 7 | Save JSON metadata with binary               | Containerization           |

All these are directly linked to your **IQ file format standard project**.

## 🧠 2. **Understand Key Topics in Depth (SDR/DSP)**

Spend 15–20 min/day mastering **1 small core concept**, like:

* Sampling, Nyquist, aliasing (visual demos)
* Phase shift and how Q = 90° offset from I
* Filtering (FIR/IIR in Python)
* FFT for IQ visualization
* Windowing and spectral leakage
* IQ imbalance and correction

🔹 Use books like **Think DSP**, **PySDR**, or Lyons’s **Understanding DSP**
🔹 Practice each with Python plots — not just theory.

## 💻 3. **Code, Git, Document**

Build your GitHub repo:

* Push every micro-lab
* Document each clearly (why, code, output, result)
* Use Jupyter or Markdown

✅ This builds **a portfolio of working skills** — critical if you want to **publish, present, or monetize** later.

---

## 🎥 4. **Watch Only One Short Video to Reinforce**

E.g., look up “IQ data explained” (no more than 10–15 mins)

* Watch, pause, and *validate what you already know* by coding or noting.

This strengthens confidence and clarity, especially visually.

---

## 🔁 5. **Repeat-Cycle Learning (Spiral Learning)**

Revisit the same signal (like a 1 kHz cosine):

* First float
* Then int8
* Then clipped
* Then filtered
* Then visualized via FFT
* Then resampled or corrupted and corrected

👉 The **signal is the same**, but you **do more each cycle** — this makes your understanding *deep and applied*, not scattered.

---

## 🔚 Bottom Line:

You're not far from crossing the zone where:

> “It feels like I’m learning” → **“I know how to build”**

If you follow this mix of:

* Daily hands-on (lab notebook style)
* One-topic-a-day theory drills
* Mini Git-based portfolio
* Daily check-ins
