# 🛰️ Counter-Drone IQ Data Detection – DSP & SDR Mission

This repository documents a structured, hands-on journey into digital signal processing (DSP) and software-defined radio (SDR) with a focus on **drone signal detection** using IQ data.

The aim is to learn deeply, document well, develop tools, and ultimately publish real-world signal analysis results — all from first principles to deployment.
