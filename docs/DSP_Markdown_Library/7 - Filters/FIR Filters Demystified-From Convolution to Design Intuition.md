# üß© PART 1 ‚Äî FIR Filters: What, Why, and How

---

### ‚úÖ **1. What is an FIR Filter?**

**FIR = Finite Impulse Response**

> A filter where the output depends only on a finite number of past input samples.

### üìò FIR Equation:

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] \cdot x[n - k]
$$

Where:

* $h[k]$: filter coefficients (impulse response)
* $x[n]$: input signal
* $y[n]$: output signal
* $N$: number of taps (filter length)

### üîç Why ‚ÄúImpulse Response‚Äù?

* Apply a delta input (1 followed by 0s)
* Output = the **coefficients themselves** ‚Üí hence the name

---

### ‚úÖ **2. How Does It Work? (Sliding Dot Product)**

* At each time $n$, you **slide $h[k]$** over input $x[n]$
* Take a **dot product** to compute one output value
* This is **convolution**

### üí¨ Lyons Analogy:

> Like a moving weighted average with memory ‚Äî each output is a blend of recent inputs

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Key Properties of FIR Filters**

| Feature                    | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear Phase               | Symmetric $h[n]$ ‚Üí no phase distortion (important in comms/audio) |
| Always Stable              | No feedback = no runaway output                                   |
| Easy to Design             | Especially via windowing                                          |
| Good for Multirate Systems | Used in up/down-sampling pipelines                                |

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Types of FIR Filters by Coefficient Shape**

| Filter Type    | Coefficients Shape      |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Low-pass       | Smooth sinc-like        |
| High-pass      | Alternating signs       |
| Band-pass      | Band-limited sinc       |
| Notch          | Impulse + negative bump |
| Moving Average | All ones                |

---

# üß© PART 2 ‚Äî FIR Filtering via Convolution & Frequency Domain

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Convolution = Core Operation**

$$
y[n] = x[n] * h[n]
$$

* $*$: convolution operator
* Intuitively: **blending input with filter shape**
* Mathematically: **sum of weighted, time-shifted inputs**

---

### ‚úÖ **6. Convolution ‚Üî Frequency Multiplication**

Lyons emphasizes:

> "Filtering in time = shaping the spectrum in frequency."

| Time Domain  | Frequency Domain                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Convolution  | Multiplication                    |
| FIR filter   | Windowed sinc = frequency gate    |
| Apply $h[n]$ | Suppress/pass spectral components |

### üåê Design Insight:

* Want low-pass? Use sinc (ideal LPF) ‚Üí window it ‚Üí truncate to finite taps

---

### ‚úÖ **7. Practical Design Flow (as per Lyons)**

#### Step-by-step FIR Low-pass Design:

1. Choose sampling rate $f_s$
2. Pick cutoff frequency $f_c$
3. Build ideal sinc function:

   $$
   h[n] = \text{sinc}\left(\frac{2f_c}{f_s}(n - \frac{N-1}{2})\right)
   $$
4. Apply window (e.g., Hamming)
5. Normalize (so gain = 1 at DC)

---

### ‚úÖ **8. What to Remember Going Forward**

| Concept                | Insight                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| FIR = convolution      | Dot product of input and impulse response        |
| Shape of $h[n]$        | Defines the spectral behavior                    |
| Number of taps         | More taps ‚Üí sharper cutoff but more delay        |
| Symmetry in $h[n]$     | Ensures linear phase                             |
| Windowing              | Balances leakage vs sharpness                    |
| Design with `firwin()` | Automates steps above using Python (e.g., SciPy) |

## üß™ Suggested Hands-on Activities (with Python or Paper)

1. **Visualize convolution** using small signals and filter coefficients
2. Plot time-domain response of FIR low-pass filter
3. Use `freqz()` to inspect frequency response
4. Compare filters with 21, 51, 101 taps
5. Try filtering real signal (e.g., 500 Hz + 2000 Hz sine mix)
