# **Chapter 4.2 - FFT Twiddle Rotations and Frequency Bins — A Layman’s Guide**

## **1️⃣ Digital Samples and Sampling Interval**

* FFT works on **N digital samples**.
* **ΔT** = time between consecutive digital samples.
* **Fs** = 1 / ΔT → sampling frequency.

**Key:**

* N → number of samples analyzed
* ΔT → spacing between samples, determines frequency resolution
* Total FFT window duration = N \* ΔT

## **2️⃣ Rotating Arrows and Twiddle Factor**

* Each FFT bin k has a **complex arrow** that rotates.
* Rotation per sample is determined by the **twiddle factor**:

$$
W^{kn} = e^{-j 2 \pi k n / N}
$$

* **Higher k → faster rotation → higher frequency**.
* Each sample x\[n] scales the arrow; summing all arrows → X\[k].

**Intuition:**

* If the arrow rotation matches the signal frequency → arrows align → strong magnitude.
* If not → arrows cancel → small magnitude.

---

## **3️⃣ Frequency Comes from Rotation**

* Frequency represented by bin k:

$$
f = k / (N \cdot ΔT) = k \cdot Fs / N
$$

* Phase progression at sample n:

$$
phase = 2 \pi f n ΔT
$$

**Takeaway:**

* k → controls rotation speed → higher k = faster rotation
* n → sample position in the FFT
* ΔT → determines how fast the phase rotates per sample

## **4️⃣ Complex Vector Sum**

* X\[k] = sum over n of x\[n] \* W^{kn}
* Magnitude → strength of that frequency
* Phase → timing offset

> Tiny imaginary parts in Python output are floating-point noise.

## **5️⃣ Nyquist Limit**

* Maximum frequency measurable = Fs / 2 → **Nyquist frequency**
* Bin N/2 → Nyquist frequency
* Bins above N/2 → mirrored negative frequencies (aliasing if signal exceeds Nyquist)

✅ **Head-First Insight:**

* Each bin = a **frequency tuner**
* Arrow rotation = how k, n, and ΔT interact to detect that frequency
* FFT bins sum contributions of all samples → magnitude and phase
* Maximum measurable frequency = Nyquist (Fs/2)
