# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 5.3: Capturing, Normalizing, and Preparing IQ Data from RTL-SDR

## 1. Purpose

When working with RTL-SDR or any SDR receiver, the received IQ samples are usually saved in a **raw binary file**. This file must be correctly **read, interpreted, normalized, reshaped, and corrected** before further DSP or research work can be performed.

The main goals are:

1. Correctly extract I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) components.
2. Normalize samples into a meaningful numeric range (typically `-1` to `+1`).
3. Handle **hardware DC offset** or imbalance.
4. Ensure reshaping produces clean IQ pairs for FFTs, constellation diagrams, and higher-level processing.
---
## 2. Data Format (Why 127.5 Appears Everywhere)

* RTL-SDR saves IQ samples as **unsigned 8-bit integers** (`uint8`).
* Values range from **0 â†’ 255**.
* But real signals must be **zero-centered** (negative and positive swings).
* To convert:

$$
\text{normalized\_sample} = \frac{(\text{raw\_sample} - 127.5)}{127.5}
$$

* Subtracting **127.5** recenters values around 0.
* Dividing by **127.5** scales values into `[-1, +1]`.
* Example:

  * Raw = 0 â†’ (0 - 127.5) / 127.5 = -1
  * Raw = 127.5 â†’ 0
  * Raw = 255 â†’ +1

So after this, the samples are in proper floating-point range.
---
## 3. Two Levels of Correction

Hereâ€™s the **critical clarification** about why sometimes we see corrections done **twice** â€” once on `raw`, and again on `I` and `Q`.

### Level 1: **Hardware Normalization (raw level)**

* Removes unsigned storage bias (0â€“255 â†’ -1..+1).
* Ensures signal swings are mathematically valid.
* Equation: `(raw - 127.5)/127.5`.

### Level 2: **Channel Balancing (I/Q level)**

* Even after normalization, **hardware imperfections** remain:

  * DC offset (mean â‰  0).
  * I/Q imbalance (different mean or gain between I and Q).
* So, we compute:

$$
I_0 = I - \text{mean}(I)
$$

$$
Q_0 = Q - \text{mean}(Q)
$$

This ensures both I and Q are strictly zero-centered.

ðŸ”‘ **Answer to your concern:**
If we only subtract the global mean at the raw stage (`raw0 = raw - raw.mean()`), we do not account for **I and Q differences individually**. Thus, **both levels are required** for precision SDR research work.
---
## 4. Experiment: Using `raw - raw.mean()`

Suppose instead of `(raw - 127.5)/127.5`, we try:
python
raw0 = raw - raw.mean()

* This removes **global bias** across the entire dataset.
* But SDR data is structured as alternating I, Q samples.
* If I has mean = 0.01 and Q has mean = -0.02, their biases will **cancel** in the global mean.
* Net result: residual offsets in I/Q that distort constellation and FFT plots.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why raw\.mean() subtraction **is not enough** for serious SDR work.

## 5. Step-by-Step Python Code

Below is the **final combined code** with all stages clearly separated and documented.

python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. Load raw RTL-SDR data
filename = r"C:\IQ_Data\Prac_1.bin"
fs = 2400000  # Sample rate in Hz
raw = np.fromfile(filename, dtype=np.uint8)
print("Length of raw data:", len(raw))

# 2. Convert to float and normalize to [-1, +1]
raw = raw.astype(np.float32)
raw = (raw - 127.5) / 127.5
print("Raw normalized:", raw[:10])  # Show first 10 samples

# 3. Optional global DC removal (rarely enough by itself)
raw0 = raw - raw.mean()
print("Raw0 global corrected, mean:", raw0.mean())

# 4. Ensure even length for IQ pairs
if len(raw) % 2 != 0:
    raw = raw[:-1]

# 5. Reshape into I/Q pairs
IQ = raw.reshape(-1, 2)
I = IQ[:, 0]
Q = IQ[:, 1]

# 6. Channel-specific DC removal
I0 = I - I.mean()
Q0 = Q - Q.mean()

# 7. Diagnostics
print(f"Raw min/max after normalize: {raw.min():.3f}, {raw.max():.3f}")
print(f"Mean(I), Mean(Q): {I.mean():.4f}, {Q.mean():.4f} (before DC removal)")
print(f"Mean(I0), Mean(Q0): {I0.mean():.4f}, {Q0.mean():.4f} (after DC removal)")

# 8. Quick plot check
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
plt.scatter(I0[:5000], Q0[:5000], s=1, alpha=0.5)
plt.title("Constellation Plot (DC Removed)")
plt.xlabel("I")
plt.ylabel("Q")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

## 6. Typical Output

Length of raw data: 14516224
Raw normalized: [-0.992, -0.976, -0.960, ...]
Raw0 global corrected, mean: ~0.000
Raw min/max after normalize: -1.000, 1.000
Mean(I), Mean(Q): 0.0123, -0.0087 (before DC removal)
Mean(I0), Mean(Q0): 0.0000, 0.0000 (after DC removal)

Constellation plot: shows **symmetric scatter around zero** after proper correction.

## 7. Key Takeaways

1. **Normalization with 127.5** is required because RTL-SDR stores unsigned bytes.
2. Subtracting only `raw.mean()` is insufficient â€” I and Q need **separate correction**.
3. Double-handling (raw level + I/Q level) is **not redundancy**; itâ€™s best practice.
4. Always check with **plots** (FFT, constellation) to confirm correction worked.
5. This pipeline is the foundation for **further DSP research** (demodulation, drone-signal detection, etc.).
