# Chapter 1: Understanding Noise in Signals ‚Äî A Clean Python Walkthrough
## üåü Objective
In digital signal processing (DSP) and software-defined radio (SDR), noise is unavoidable. Understanding how to **simulate noise** helps us:
* Design and test filters
* Build robust DSP systems
* Learn signal recovery techniques
This chapter focuses on using **Python** to simulate different types of noise and lays the groundwork for applying filters effectively.

## ‚úÖ Section 1: Adding White Gaussian Noise (WGN)
üîç What is it?
White Gaussian noise is the most common type of noise in DSP. It mimics thermal noise and affects all frequencies equally. It's random, zero-mean, and follows a bell-curve (normal) distribution.
‚úÖ Code Walkthrough
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Generate a clean 5 Hz sine wave
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 500)  # Time axis: 0 to 1 sec, 500 samples
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * t)  # Sine wave
# Add Gaussian noise
np.random.seed(0)  # For reproducibility
noise = 0.5 * np.random.randn(len(t))  # Scaled noise
noisy_signal = signal + noise  # Combine signal and noise
# Plot
plt.plot(t, signal, label='Clean Signal')
plt.plot(t, noisy_signal, label='With Gaussian Noise', alpha=0.7)
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.title("White Gaussian Noise")
plt.show()
‚úÖ What It Achieves
* Simulates realistic noise in communication and sensor systems
* Provides a baseline for testing low-pass filters
* The `np.random.randn()` function generates zero-mean, unit variance noise
## ‚úÖ Section 2: Adding Impulse Noise (Spikes)
### üîç What is it?
Impulse noise consists of sudden, high-amplitude disturbances. It simulates glitches, dropouts, or digital bit errors.
‚úÖ Code Walkthrough
# Copy the clean signal
impulse_signal = np.copy(signal)
# Inject spikes at random positions
num_spikes = 20
spike_indices = np.random.randint(0, len(t), size=num_spikes)
spike_values = np.random.choice([2.5, -2.5], size=num_spikes)
impulse_signal[spike_indices] += spike_values
# Plot
plt.plot(t, signal, label='Clean Signal')
plt.plot(t, impulse_signal, label='With Impulse Noise', alpha=0.7)
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.title("Impulse Noise (Random Spikes)")
plt.show()
‚úÖ What It Achieves
* Models real-world glitches in hardware
* Helps evaluate filters like **median** or **adaptive** filters
* Simulates sharp, unpredictable noise that a moving average filter may not remove well
## ‚úÖ Section 3: Adding Low-Frequency Drift (Sensor Drift)
### üîç What is it?
Low-frequency drift simulates slow, gradual changes in signal level. This often happens in sensors due to temperature or calibration changes.
‚úÖ Code Walkthrough
# Add a slow sine wave as drift
drift = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 0.5 * t)  # 0.5 Hz drift
drifted_signal = signal + drift
# Plot
plt.plot(t, signal, label='Clean Signal')
plt.plot(t, drifted_signal, label='With Low-Frequency Drift', alpha=0.7)
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.title("Low-Frequency Drift")
plt.show()
‚úÖ What It Achieves
* Simulates slow sensor bias
* Useful for testing **high-pass** or **baseline correction** filters
* Shows how a signal can appear shifted or warped
## ‚úÖ Section 4: Adding Composite Noise
### üîç What is it?
Composite noise combines multiple noise types. This is more realistic because most real-world signals contain a mix of noise sources.
‚úÖ Code Walkthrough
# Combine Gaussian noise and low-frequency drift
composite_noise = 0.4 * np.random.randn(len(t)) + 0.3 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 0.8 * t)
noisy_composite = signal + composite_noise
# Plot
plt.plot(t, signal, label='Clean Signal')
plt.plot(t, noisy_composite, label='With Composite Noise', alpha=0.7)
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.title("Composite Noise: Gaussian + Drift")
plt.show()
‚úÖ What It Achieves
* Simulates real-world environmental and system noise
* Prepares you to design **robust filters**
* Great for end-to-end DSP simulations
