Mental Model: Digital Signal Processing: Time ↔ Frequency Reality

### 🔹 1. **Time Domain = Where the Work Happens**

* **Everything is stored and manipulated as sequences of numbers**:
  $x[n], h[n], y[n]$
* You apply filters, convolution, algorithms, etc. **in time domain**
* **Mathematical operations like `lfilter`, `convolve`, etc.** work directly on samples
* All code, hardware, and real-time systems process signal **sample by sample**, or block-by-block

> 💡 Time domain is the “hands-on workspace” of DSP.

### 🔹 2. **Frequency Domain = Where You Analyze the Effect**

* You switch to frequency domain (via FFT, DFT) to:

  * Understand what your signal is made of (spectrum)
  * Verify filter behavior (e.g., does it cut off 2 kHz as intended?)
  * Design or interpret filter responses

* **But you don’t operate directly in frequency domain unless needed** (e.g., FFT filtering, spectral subtraction)

> 💡 Frequency domain is the “diagnostic lens” — you *see* the effect of what you did in time domain.

### 🔹 3. **The Complete System (Tx–Rx)**

Let’s walk through what you hinted — a **real-world DSP path** from analog to digital and back:

---

### 📡 TRANSMISSION SIDE:

1. **Analog signal (microphone, antenna)**
   ↓
2. **ADC** → samples it to produce $x[n]$
   ↓
3. **Digital filtering / modulation / encoding (DSP)**
   ↓
4. **DAC** → converts it back to analog
   ↓
5. **Transmission** (RF, audio, etc.)

---

### 📶 RECEIVER SIDE:

1. **Analog input (antenna, sensor)**
   ↓
2. **ADC** → digitizes to $x[n]$
   ↓
3. **DSP applies filtering, detection, demodulation**
   ↓
4. **You extract information** (audio, video, IQ, data)

## ✅ Key Principles (What to Remember)

| Concept          | Role                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time Domain      | Where DSP happens (convolution, filtering, modulation) |
| Frequency Domain | Where interpretation and filter design is verified     |
| ADC              | Converts real-world signal → digital samples           |
| DSP              | Processes those samples using mathematical operations  |
| DAC              | Converts processed digital samples → analog signal     |

## 🧰 Real-World Analogy:

| Stage                 | Analogy                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time domain filtering | Cooking: you follow a recipe (weighted steps on samples)            |
| Frequency domain      | Nutrition label: shows how healthy the output is (what’s inside)    |
| ADC/DAC               | Converts between **ingredients** (analog) and **numbers** (digital) |
