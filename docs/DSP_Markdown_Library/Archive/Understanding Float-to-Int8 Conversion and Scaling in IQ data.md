### üéØAppendix ‚Äî Understanding Float-to-Int8 Conversion and Scaling
**Why Do We Convert float32 IQ Data to int8?**

Most SDR systems process IQ data in high-precision floating-point (like `float32`), but this format is bulky (4 bytes per sample) and inefficient for storage/transmission. To reduce data size and meet standard SDR format expectations (like 8-bit IQ files), we **scale and convert** these float values into `int8`.

### üß± What is int8 and Why Use 127?

* `int8` is an 8-bit signed integer type
* It can hold values from **‚Äì128 to +127**
* We use **127** as the scale factor so that normalized float values from **‚Äì1.0 to +1.0** are mapped to the full int8 range:

```python
scaled = (float_values * 127).astype(np.int8)
```

This way:

* `-1.0 ‚Üí -127`
* `0.0 ‚Üí 0`
* `1.0 ‚Üí +127`

This **maximizes resolution** while avoiding overflow (note: +128 doesn‚Äôt exist in int8).

### üß† The Real Meaning of "Detail"

**Detail** refers to how many unique levels (steps) you can preserve from the original signal. Here's why scaling is critical:

| Scaling Factor | Usable int8 Levels | Signal Quality |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 10             | ‚Äì10 to +10 (21)    | ‚ùå Coarse       |
| 127            | ‚Äì127 to +127 (255) | ‚úÖ Fine         |

If you scale by 10, you're throwing away 90% of the potential precision of int8.

### üìè What is Quantization Error?

After scaling, float values must be **rounded** to the nearest integer. This introduces a small error:

```python
quant_error = original_value - (scaled_value / scale_factor)
```

Smaller scale ‚Üí bigger step size ‚Üí higher error
Full scale (127) ‚Üí smallest error possible for int8

### üß™ Example

```python
x = np.array([-1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0], dtype=np.float32)
print((x * 127).astype(np.int8))
# Output: [-127, -63, 0, 63, 127]
```

This keeps the shape of the waveform.

Compare that with:

```python
print((x * 10).astype(np.int8))
# Output: [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10] ‚Äî coarse!
```

---

### üö´ What if float > 1.0?

This can cause overflow:

```python
x = np.array([3.2])
print((x * 127).astype(np.int8))
# Output: wraps around ‚Äî wrong result
```

### ‚úÖ Solutions:

1. **Normalize first:**

```python
x = x / np.max(np.abs(x))
```

2. **Or clip values:**

```python
x = np.clip(x, -1.0, 1.0)
```

### üìå Closing Insight:

Even though your float signal is already sampled and quantized, converting to int8 is a **second-stage quantization** that trades off space for precision. To preserve signal shape, amplitude detail, and minimize loss, scaling by 127 is the practical and standardized method in IQ data workflows.

This step is critical for SDR data formatting, compression, visualization, and downstream DSP operations.
