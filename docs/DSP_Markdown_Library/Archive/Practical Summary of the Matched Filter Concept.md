# üéØ Matched Filter: Summary for DSP/SDR & IQ Applications

---

## üìò What Is a Matched Filter?

A **matched filter** is a signal processing technique used to **detect a known signal pattern** (template) embedded in a longer signal, often corrupted by noise. It's a **correlation-based detector** that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for that pattern.

---

## üß† Core Idea

> Slide the time-reversed version of a known signal across the input. Wherever there is a strong match, a **peak** appears in the output.

### üìê Mathematically:

If known signal (template) is:

$$
s[n] = [a, b, c]
$$

Then matched filter is:

$$
h[n] = [c, b, a] \quad \text{(time-reversed)}
$$

Output:

$$
y[n] = x[n] * h[n] = \sum x[k] \cdot h[n - k]
$$

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use It

1. **Define your known pattern**: `s = [1, 2, 1]`
2. **Reverse it**: `h = s[::-1]`
3. **Convolve with input signal**: `y = np.convolve(x, h, mode='full')`
4. **Locate peaks in `y[n]`** ‚Üí pattern is detected
5. **Find pattern start index** using:

   $$
   \text{start} = \text{peak index} - (L - 1)
   $$

## üõ†Ô∏è Python Example

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

s = np.array([1, 2, 1])  # known pattern
x = np.array([0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0])  # received signal
h = s[::-1]  # matched filter
y = np.convolve(x, h, mode='full')

peak_idx = np.argmax(y)
start_idx = peak_idx - (len(h) - 1)

print("Peak at:", peak_idx)
print("Pattern starts at:", start_idx)
```

---

## üìä What You‚Äôll See

* A **clear peak** at the point where the known pattern is detected.
* The **start of the pattern** occurs `len(h) - 1` samples **before the peak**.

## üß† Physical & SDR Interpretation

| Concept        | Meaning in SDR                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Peak in `y[n]` | Pattern detected (e.g., preamble, sync signal)        |
| Start index    | Where IQ data of interest begins                      |
| Time reversal  | Ensures energy is accumulated from front to back      |
| SNR boost      | Enhances detection of low-amplitude or buried signals |
| Multiple peaks | Multiple occurrences (e.g., packets, pulses)          |

## üß™ Real-World SDR Applications

| Application                | Use of Matched Filter                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Preamble detection**     | Detect sync sequence before packet    |
| **Burst detection**        | Find transient signals in wideband IQ |
| **Radar pulse detection**  | Echo matching to transmitted pulse    |
| **Symbol synchronization** | Locate exact symbol start             |
| **Spread spectrum (CDMA)** | Match spreading codes                 |

---

## ‚úÖ Key Points to Remember

* Matched filter = time-reversed template.
* Output peak shows strongest correlation.
* Start of pattern = `peak index - (len(template) - 1)`
* It **maximizes SNR** for that specific signal pattern.
* Essential for any SDR receiver looking for known patterns in IQ streams.
