## ðŸŽ¯ Relevance to Your SDR Standards Project

When handling IQ data:

* You'll need to **simulate channel effects** â†’ use echo, multipath filters.
* For **pre/post-processing**: smooth noise (`moving average`), detect modulation changes (`difference filters`), extract carriers (`band-pass`).
* When testing compliance â†’ use **matched filters** to detect known signal structures.
