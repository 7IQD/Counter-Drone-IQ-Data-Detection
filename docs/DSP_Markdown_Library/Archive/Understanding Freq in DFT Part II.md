## üîπ 1. WHAT IS FFT *DOING* (Without Saying It‚Äôs Just Faster DFT)?

FFT:

* **Does exactly what DFT does**, but in a **clever order**.
* It breaks a problem of size `N` into two problems of size `N/2`, and does this recursively.
* It avoids recomputing the same math again and again.

## üîπ 2. VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE: FFT of 4-Point Signal

Let‚Äôs take a **real signal**:

$$
x = [1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4]
$$

We want to compute the **4-point DFT** of this, i.e.,

$$
X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{3} x[n] \cdot e^{-j 2\pi kn / 4},\quad \text{for } k = 0,1,2,3
$$

But **using FFT logic**, we'll:

### ‚öôÔ∏è STEP 1: Divide into Even and Odd Samples

Split `x`:

* Even-indexed samples: `x_even = [1, 3]` (positions 0 and 2)
* Odd-indexed samples: `x_odd = [2, 4]` (positions 1 and 3)

Now do 2-point DFT on each:

### ‚öôÔ∏è STEP 2: 2-Point DFT of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`

$$
\text{DFT of } [a,\ b] = [a + b,\ a - b]
$$

So:

* `DFT_even = [1+3, 1‚àí3] = [4, -2]`
* `DFT_odd  = [2+4, 2‚àí4] = [6, -2]`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è STEP 3: Twiddle Factor Multiplication

We now apply the *twiddle factor* $W_N^k = e^{-j2\pi k/N}$ to the **odd** part.

Let‚Äôs build final output for each bin $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$:

$$
X[k] = \text{DFT\_even}[k \bmod 2] + W_4^k \cdot \text{DFT\_odd}[k \bmod 2]
$$

We calculate:

#### For k = 0:

* $W_4^0 = 1$
* $X[0] = 4 + 1 \cdot 6 = 10$

#### For k = 1:

* $W_4^1 = e^{-j\pi/2} = -j$
* $X[1] = -2 + (-j)(-2) = -2 + 2j$

#### For k = 2:

* $W_4^2 = e^{-j\pi} = -1$
* $X[2] = 4 + (-1) \cdot 6 = -2$

#### For k = 3:

* $W_4^3 = e^{-j3\pi/2} = j$
* $X[3] = -2 + j(-2) = -2 - 2j$

---

‚úÖ **FFT Output:**

$$
X = [10,\ -2+2j,\ -2,\ -2-2j]
$$

That‚Äôs your 4-point FFT manually!
