### üß± The Moving Average Filter ‚Äî Explained from First Principles
üéØ Objective:
To reduce **noise** in a signal using a **simple low-pass filter** ‚Äî specifically, a **moving average filter**.
A **moving average filter** works by replacing each sample in a signal with the **average of its neighbors**.
Think of it like:
> "Instead of trusting one value, I‚Äôll look at a few values around it and smooth things out."
This is great for:
* Smoothing out short-term noise
* Keeping the overall shape of the signal intact
* Acting as a **low-pass filter** (because it removes rapid changes = high frequency)
üîç What's Under the Hood?
Let‚Äôs say we have this tiny signal:
Signal:     [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
If we apply a 3-point moving average filter, we use this kernel:
Kernel:     [1/3, 1/3, 1/3]
Then each new value is:
New[1] = (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4
New[2] = (4 + 6 + 8)/3 = 6
New[3] = (6 + 8 + 10)/3 = 8
So the output is smoothed:
Filtered:   [4, 6, 8]
üîÑ This Operation Is Called **Convolution**
We "slide" the kernel over the signal and compute dot products at each step. This is the core of **convolution filtering**.
In Python, we use:
    np.convolve(signal, kernel, mode='same'):
    *`signal`: your noisy signal
    *`kernel`: the filter (moving average here)
    *`mode='same'`: keeps the output size equal to the input size
    **Why 'valid' mode?**
    *'valid': Keeps only the parts where the kernel fully overlaps (result is shorter).
    *'same': Pads to maintain original length (useful for real-time filtering).
    *'full': Even includes the parts with partial overlap (longer result).
