# 🎯 **Day 1 Exercise – Generate and Plot a Cosine Wave**

## 🧠 Goal:

Understand how frequency, sampling rate, and duration define a digital signal. You'll simulate a basic cosine wave using Python and plot it over time.

## 📂 File: `1_generate_cosine.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Define parameters
Fs = 1000         # Sampling rate (samples per second)
f = 10            # Frequency of cosine wave (Hz)
T = 1             # Total duration (seconds)
t = np.arange(0, T, 1/Fs)  # Time vector

# Step 2: Generate the cosine wave
x = np.cos(2 * np.pi * f * t)

# Step 3: Plot the signal
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(t, x, label='cos(2πft)')
plt.title(f'Cosine Wave: {f} Hz, Sampled at {Fs} Hz')
plt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 📝 Observation Checklist

Tick ✅ as you complete each:

* [ ] Change `f` to 50 Hz. What do you observe in the plot?
* [ ] Reduce `Fs` to 40 Hz and set `f = 30 Hz`. Do you notice distortion? (Aliasing?)
* [ ] Increase `T` to 2 seconds. What happens to waveform clarity?

## 💡 Concepts to Log in `phase1_observations.md`

```
# Day 1 – Cosine Simulation

- Sampling rate used: 1000 Hz
- Signal frequency: 10 Hz
- Observation: Wave is smooth and periodic over 1 sec
- Changed Fs to 40 Hz and f to 30 Hz → observed aliasing pattern
- Learning: To avoid distortion, Fs must be at least 2x f (Nyquist Rule)
```
