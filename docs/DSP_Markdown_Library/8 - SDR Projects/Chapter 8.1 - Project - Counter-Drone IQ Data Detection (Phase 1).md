# 🔹 Project: *Counter-Drone IQ Data Detection (Phase 1)*

**Vision (Product Goal):**
Develop a working pipeline to **capture, visualize, and analyze IQ data** using RTL-SDR, moving towards drone signal characterization.

**Value Delivery:**
By the end of 12 weeks, you’ll have a working repo with reproducible scripts that:

1. Capture IQ samples from RTL-SDR.
2. Stream/process samples in real time.
3. Perform FFT and visualize signals.
4. Document findings → towards counter-drone detection.

# 🔹 Agile Setup

* **Framework:** Scrum with Kanban board for tasks.
* **Timebox:** 2-week sprints.
* **Cadence:** Daily check-ins (short), Weekly sprint reviews, Sprint retrospectives.
* **Increment Strategy:** Each sprint must produce a working piece (code, visualization, analysis, repo update).

---

# 🔹 Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2) → *Kick-off & First Capture*

**Sprint Goal:**
👉 “Be able to capture and visualize stored IQ samples with RTL-SDR in Python.”

**Sprint Backlog (User Stories & Tasks):**

* [ ] **Set up Kanban Board** (To Do, In Progress, Done).
* [ ] **Confirm Environment** – RTL-SDR working in Python (done ✅).
* [ ] **Capture IQ Samples** – Write script to record samples into `.bin` file.
* [ ] **Read IQ File** – Parse samples in Python (separate I/Q).
* [ ] **Visualize Waveform** – Plot time-domain IQ data.
* [ ] **FFT Spectrum** – Plot frequency-domain spectrum of captured file.
* [ ] **Documentation** – Notes + GitHub push.

**Definition of Done:**

* At least one `.bin` IQ capture file saved.
* Code to load and plot IQ data (time + FFT).
* Repo updated with scripts & README.

# 🔹 Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4) → *Streaming & Real-Time Plots*

**Sprint Goal:**
👉 “Stream live IQ data from RTL-SDR and visualize in real time.”

# 🔹 Our Kanban Flow

**To Do → In Progress → Review → Done**
(We’ll keep updating this as tasks move across.)
