## 📚 **Head First Mission Control — Complete Journey Index**

## **1️⃣ Core Deliverables**

**\[A] Research & Technical**

1. **Research Paper** — DSP/SDR-based counter-drone or IQ format work (4–6 months target, weekly logs)
2. **Practical Skills** — Python (DSP, NumPy, Matplotlib, SDR libraries) + RTL-SDR handling & live IQ data work
3. **IQ Data Standards / PhD Topic** — Lightweight IQ format spec, validation rules, annexures

**\[B] Career & Profile**
4\. **GitHub Repository** — Organized, documented, weekly commits as proof-of-work
5\. **LinkedIn Profile** — Skills, proof-of-skill posts, project highlights
6\. **Resume** — Projects, research achievements, open-source contributions

## **2️⃣ Skill Pillars**

**Pillar 1 — Python Foundations** \[A+B]

* Data types, control flow, functions
* NumPy basics: shapes, slicing, indexing
* Plotting with Matplotlib
* File I/O and struct handling for SDR data

**Pillar 2 — DSP Core** \[A]

* Discrete-time signals, sampling, Nyquist
* FFT fundamentals (bins, Δf, leakage, windowing)
* Filters (FIR, IIR basics)
* Spectrograms & time-frequency trade-offs

**Pillar 3 — SDR Hands-On** \[A]

* RTL-SDR setup & live capture
* IQ data visualization and processing
* Signal detection & frequency estimation
* Application tie-in (counter-drone / comms analysis)

**Pillar 4 — Standards Development** \[A]

* IQ file structure specification
* Validation & metadata handling
* Routing and structure guidelines for SDR software

**Pillar 5 — Public Proof of Work** \[B]

* Weekly GitHub commits with clear readmes
* LinkedIn technical posts (plots, findings)
* Resume updates after every milestone

## **3️⃣ Milestone Phases**

1. **Foundation Phase** (Weeks 1–4)

   * Python, NumPy shapes & slicing
   * Basic FFT experiments on synthetic data

2. **Application Phase** (Weeks 5–8)

   * RTL-SDR setup, live IQ captures
   * FFT on real signals, leakage control, filtering

3. **Research Phase** (Weeks 9–12)

   * Data analysis for paper
   * Begin drafting IQ format annexures

4. **Publication & Profile Phase** (Weeks 13–16)

   * Submit paper draft
   * Finalize GitHub repo & LinkedIn case studies
   * Update resume

## **4️⃣ Tracking Rules**

* **Bin Size Warning Protocol:** if chat ≈ 150 messages or heavy data/code, alert:

  > “⚠️ Mission Control: N too large, Δf slowing — start fresh buffer.”

* **Tag Every Task:** `[A]`, `[B]`, `[A+B]`

* **Proof Requirement:** every week must show **evidence** — code, plot, doc, or capture — committed to GitHub

## **6️⃣ Weekly Checklist**

* [ ] One technical skill advanced
* [ ] One deliverable progressed
* [ ] One proof pushed to GitHub
* [ ] One public-facing update (LinkedIn/GitHub)
* [ ] Mission Control review of pacing
