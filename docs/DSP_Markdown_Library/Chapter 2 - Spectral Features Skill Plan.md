## 🧠 **Spectral Features Skill Plan (No-Fluff, Build-You Approach)**

### 🔧 Phase 1: Spectral Foundation (5 Mini-Tasks)

**Goal:** Understand and trust your FFT skills — from raw signal to peak frequency.
Each task = 10–15 lines of code + 1 concept.

| Task | Title                           | Skill Outcome                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1    | Sine wave → FFT plot            | Read frequency content            |
| 2    | Two tones + detect both         | Handle multi-signal analysis      |
| 3    | Peak detect in noise            | Isolate real signals from clutter |
| 4    | Sweep a sine → plot spectrogram | Time-varying signal understanding |
| 5    | FFT resolution vs sample rate   | Tune SDR capture settings smartly |

### 🔍 Phase 2: Feature Extraction (5 Targeted Drills)

**Goal:** Build a Python toolkit for real spectral features.

| Task | Title                           | Skill Outcome                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 6    | Spectral Centroid               | Track average frequency shift |
| 7    | Bandwidth from FFT              | Estimate drone signal spread  |
| 8    | Spectral Roll-off (e.g. 85%)    | Measure energy spread         |
| 9    | dB-scale spectrum visualization | Professional signal plotting  |
| 10   | Build `extract_features()` func | Reusable SDR analysis block   |

### 📡 Phase 3: Real Signal Use Cases (SDR-style mini projects)

You’ll use **real IQ data or synthetic bursts** and apply what you learned:

| Task | Title                                     | Real-World Relevance               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 11   | Simulate a drone burst → detect it        | Prepare for real telemetry capture |
| 12   | Extract spectral features from IQ samples | Begin feature logging pipeline     |
| 13   | Sliding-window FFT (like waterfall view)  | Move toward real-time detection    |
