### 14 Days Plan - "CMM Trip to Level 3: DSP Foundations & IQ Mastery"
* **Deep understanding of filters** (poles, zeros, stability, frequency response)
* **Hands-on IQ signal processing**
* **Contributing to projects like IQEngine**
* **Moving up the Capability Maturity Model to Level 3**

Here’s how we can structure a **focused 14-day mini-plan** to get you there:

## **14-Day Plan: Hello World → DSP → Filters → IQEngine**

### **Week 1: Foundations & Hands-on IQ**

**Day 1–2:**

* Generate synthetic IQ snippets (like `hello.iq`)
* Create matching `.sigmf-meta`
* Visualize **I/Q waveforms**

**Day 3–4:**

* Compute **FFT, magnitude, power, phase**
* Understand **role of sample rate, center frequency, datatype**
* Plot spectrum and annotate peaks

**Day 5–6:**

* Apply **basic filters** (lowpass, highpass, bandpass)
* Observe changes in I/Q waveforms and spectrum
* Note effects of filter parameters

**Day 7:**

* Document observations: link **raw samples → FFT → filtered waveform → insights**
* This solidifies the **DIKW journey**

---

### **Week 2: Intermediate DSP & Filter Theory**

**Day 8–9:**

* Introduce **filter theory**:

  * Poles & zeros
  * Stability criteria
  * Frequency response
* Visualize **filter magnitude & phase responses** in Python

**Day 10–11:**

* Apply **designed filters** on IQ data
* Compare **unfiltered vs filtered FFT, magnitude, power**
* Experiment with **different filter types**

**Day 12–13:**

* Explore **weighted averaging, smoothing, decimation** on IQ data
* Introduce **simple demodulation** or spectral extraction

**Day 14:**

* Integrate learning into a small **Hello World IQEngine experiment**
* Document and prepare for **next-level contributions**

---

### **Outcome after 2 weeks**

* You’ll **read, visualize, and filter IQ data confidently**
* You’ll **understand filters deeply**, including poles, zeros, and stability
* You’ll be able to **design experiments independently**, move toward Level 3 maturity
* You’ll have a **foundation for contributing to IQEngine** or similar projects
