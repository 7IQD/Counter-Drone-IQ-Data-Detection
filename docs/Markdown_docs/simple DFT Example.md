A Simple Example: Breaking Down a 4-Point Signal
Let’s say you have a signal with just 4 samples: [3, 1, 4, 2]. These could represent, say, audio amplitudes at four points in time. The FFT will tell us what frequencies (or "waves") make up this signal.

Step 1: Split into Odd and Even
Instead of computing the DFT directly (which would involve a lot of multiplications), FFT splits the signal into two smaller groups:

Even-indexed samples: [3, 4] (indices 0 and 2)
Odd-indexed samples: [1, 2] (indices 1 and 3)
Each group has 2 samples, so we can compute a smaller DFT on each. This is the "divide" part of divide-and-conquer. It’s like splitting your laundry into whites and colors to make washing easier.

Step 2: Compute DFTs on Smaller Groups
For the even samples [3, 4]:

Compute a 2-point DFT. This gives us two frequency components (let’s call them E0 and E1).
Without diving into the math, imagine this is like finding the "average wave" and "difference wave" for these two numbers.
For the odd samples [1, 2]:

Compute another 2-point DFT, giving us O0 and O1.
These smaller DFTs are simpler because they deal with fewer numbers.

Step 3: Combine with Twiddle Factors
Now, we combine the results from the even and odd DFTs to get the full 4-point DFT. The “twiddle factor” is a fancy term for a phase shift (like rotating a wave) applied to the odd samples. It’s a complex number (involving sines and cosines) that adjusts how the odd samples contribute to the final frequencies.

For a 4-point signal, the twiddle factors are specific values (like 1, -1, or complex numbers like i or -i). For each frequency output:

The first frequency (X0) is E0 + O0.
The second frequency (X1) is E1 + O1 × twiddle factor.
And so on for X2 and X3.
This combining step is efficient because it reuses the smaller DFTs and only adds a few extra operations (the twiddle multiplications).

Why is this Faster?
For 4 points, a direct DFT would take 16 multiplications (4 inputs × 4 outputs). The FFT splits it into two 2-point DFTs (each taking 4 multiplications, so 8 total) plus a few twiddle multiplications (say, 4 more). That’s roughly 12 operations instead of 16. For larger signals (like 1024 points), the savings are massive—DFT takes ~1 million operations, FFT takes ~10,000!
