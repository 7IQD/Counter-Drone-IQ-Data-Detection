---

## 📌 1. **Project Title**

**SpecSaarthi: An Offline AI-Powered Standards Mapping and Configuration Engine**

---

## 🎯 2. **Project Scope**

### Objective

To develop a **standalone, offline software application** that enables semantic search, intelligent decomposition, and standards gap detection for complex systems (e.g., UAVs, Radar, Telecom systems), and provides default specifications and validation for LRUs/SRUs.

### Key Capabilities

* Intelligent **System → Subsystem (LRU/SRU) → Standards** mapping
* CRUD database management for standards, systems, users
* AI-enabled **semantic search** and fuzzy matching
* **Offline AI inference engine** for:

  * Standards suggestion
  * Spec recommendation
  * Gap identification
* User-customized specification input + validation
* Role-based access control and report generation
